# data-curation-analysis

The primary goal of this analysis was to sort through user-generated tags from Las.fm, Spotify, and MusicBrainzID and explore the variation between the valence of the song, the arousal of the song, and the dominance of the song. There were over 90,000 songs analyzed to curate the different types of emotions and sentiments that people may experience with music. 

The data collected was found at this website: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/muse-music-sentiment-analysis . The following data set is licensed in the public domain. 

id (string) : the order of the songs listed 

track (string): the name of the track

artist (string): the name of the artist

valence_tag (integer): the tags associated with the valence of the song 

arousal_tags (integer): the tags associated with the arousal of the song 

dominance_tags (integer): the tags associated with the dominance of the song 

mbid (string): ID from MusicBrainz

spotify_id (string): ID from Spotify 

Potential issues coudl arise with this dataset because it was not listed how the tags associated are assciated with the songs. This makes trusting and categorizing the data more difficult, however the combination of data points allows others to explore and analyze the different and diverse kinds of music out there.
